    Here's a breakdown of the if-else logic:
      The first if statement checks if the position of the right climber motor is between -0.1 and climbDist (inclusive).
      If it is, the right climber motor is set to run at 25% speed.

      The second if statement checks if the position of the right climber motor is greater than or equal to climbDist.
      If it is, the right climber motor is stopped.

      The third if statement checks if the position of the left climber motor is between -0.1 and climbDist (inclusive).
      If it is, the left climber motor is set to run at 25% speed.

      The fourth if statement checks if the position of the left climber motor is greater than or equal to climbDist.
      If it is, the left climber motor is stopped.

      The final if statement checks if the positions of both the right and left climber motors are greater than or equal to climbDist.
      If they are, the climbed boolean variable is set to true.
