    Here's a breakdown of the if-else logic:

    The first if statement checks if the position of the right lowering motor is between -0.01 and lowerDist (inclusive).
    If it is, the right lowering motor is set to run at 25% speed in the reverse direction (indicated by the negative sign).

    The second if statement checks if the position of the right lowering motor is less than or equal to lowerStopDist.
    If it is, the right lowering motor is stopped.

    The third if statement checks if the position of the left lowering motor is between -0.01 and lowerDist (inclusive).
    If it is, the left lowering motor is set to run at 25% speed in the reverse direction.

    The fourth if statement checks if the position of the left lowering motor is less than or equal to lowerStopDist.
    If it is, the left lowering motor is stopped.

    The final if statement checks if the positions of both the right and left lowering motors are less than or equal to lowerStopDist.
    If they are, the lowered boolean variable is set to true.
